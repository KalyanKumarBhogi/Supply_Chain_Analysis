# Supply_Chain_Analysis

# Supply Chain Analysis: Dataset
To analyze a company’s supply chain, we need data on the different stages of the supply chain, like data about sourcing, manufacturing, transportation, inventory management, sales and customer demographics.
I found an ideal dataset for this task which includes data about the supply chain of a Fashion and Beauty startup.

# Supply Chain Analysis using Python
Let’s get started with the task of Supply Chain Analysis by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset:
*Importing all the necessary libraries*
import pandas as pd <p>
import plotly.express as px  <p>
import plotly.io as pio  <p>
import plotly.graph_objects as go <p>
pio.templates.default = "plotly_white" <p>
​*Reading the Dataset*
data = pd.read_csv("supply_chain_data.csv") <p>
*Head of the Dataset*
data.head() <p>
*Tail of the Dataset*
data.head() <p>
*To find the nulls*
data.isnull().sum() <p>
*Descriptive analysis of dataset*
data.describe() <p>
  
*Now let’s get started with analyzing the Supply Chain by looking at the relationship between the price of the products and the revenue generated by them:*

fig = px.scatter(data, x='Price',  <p>
                 y='Revenue generated',  <p>
                 color='Product type',  <p>
                 hover_data=['Number of products sold'],  <p>
                 trendline="ols") <p>
fig.show() <p>
fig = px.scatter(data, x='Price',  <p>
                 y='Revenue generated',  <p>
                 color='Product type',  <p>
                 hover_data=['Number of products sold'],  <p>
                 trendline="ols") <p>
fig.show() <p>

Thus, the company derives more revenue from skincare products, and the higher the price of skincare products, the more revenue they generate. Now let’s have a look at the sales by product type:

sales_data = data.groupby('Product type')['Number of products sold'].sum().reset_index() <p>
pie_chart = px.pie(sales_data, values='Number of products sold', names='Product type',  <p>
                   title='Sales by Product Type',  <p>
                   hover_data=['Number of products sold'], <p>
                   hole=0.5, <p>
                   color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel) <p>
                   
pie_chart.update_traces(textposition='inside', textinfo='percent+label') <p>
pie_chart.show() <p>
sales_data = data.groupby('Product type')['Number of products sold'].sum().reset_index() <p>
​
pie_chart = px.pie(sales_data, values='Number of products sold', names='Product type',  <p>
                   title='Sales by Product Type',  <p>
                   hover_data=['Number of products sold'], <p>
                   hole=0.5, <p>
                   color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel) <p>
pie_chart.update_traces(textposition='inside', textinfo='percent+label') <p>
pie_chart.show() <p>

So 45% of the business comes from skincare products, 29.5% from haircare, and 25.5% from cosmetics. Now let’s have a look at the total revenue generated from shipping carriers:

total_revenue = data.groupby('Shipping carriers')['Revenue generated'].sum().reset_index() <p>
fig = go.Figure() <p>
fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=total_revenue['Shipping carriers'],  <p>
                     y=total_revenue['Revenue generated'])) <p>
fig.update_layout(title='Total Revenue by Shipping Carrier',  <p>
                  xaxis_title='Shipping Carrier',  <p>
                  yaxis_title='Revenue Generated') <p>
fig.show() <p>
total_revenue = data.groupby('Shipping carriers')['Revenue generated'].sum().reset_index() <p>
fig = go.Figure() <p>
fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=total_revenue['Shipping carriers'],  <p>
                     y=total_revenue['Revenue generated'])) <p>
fig.update_layout(title='Total Revenue by Shipping Carrier',  <p>
                  xaxis_title='Shipping Carrier',  <p>
                  yaxis_title='Revenue Generated') <p>
fig.show() <p>

# Supply Chain Analysis: Total Revenue by Shipping Carrier
So the company is using three carriers for transportation, and Carrier B helps the company in generating more revenue. Now let’s have a look at the Average lead time and Average Manufacturing Costs for all products of the company:
 
avg_lead_time = data.groupby('Product type')['Lead time'].mean().reset_index() <p> 
avg_manufacturing_costs = data.groupby('Product type')['Manufacturing costs'].mean().reset_index() <p>
result = pd.merge(avg_lead_time, avg_manufacturing_costs, on='Product type') <p>
result.rename(columns={'Lead time': 'Average Lead Time', 'Manufacturing costs': 'Average Manufacturing Costs'}, inplace=True) <p>
print(result) <p>
avg_lead_time = data.groupby('Product type')['Lead time'].mean().reset_index() <p>
avg_manufacturing_costs = data.groupby('Product type')['Manufacturing costs'].mean().reset_index() <p>
result = pd.merge(avg_lead_time, avg_manufacturing_costs, on='Product type') <p>
result.rename(columns={'Lead time': 'Average Lead Time', 'Manufacturing costs': 'Average Manufacturing Costs'}, inplace=True) <p>
print(result) <p>
  
# Analyzing SKUs
There’s a column in the dataset as SKUs. You must have heard it for the very first time. So, SKU stands for Stock Keeping Units. They’re like special codes that help companies keep track of all the different things they have for sale. Imagine you have a large toy store with lots of toys. Each toy is different and has its name and price, but when you want to know how many you have left, you need a way to identify them. So you give each toy a unique code, like a secret number only the store knows. This secret number is called SKU.
I hope you have now understood what’s SKU. Now let’s analyze the revenue generated by each SKU:

revenue_chart = px.line(data, x='SKU',  <p>
                        y='Revenue generated',  <p>
                        title='Revenue Generated by SKU') <p>
revenue_chart.show() <p>
revenue_chart = px.line(data, x='SKU',  <p>
                        y='Revenue generated',  <p>
                        title='Revenue Generated by SKU') <p>
revenue_chart.show() <p>

# Revenue Generated by SKU
There’s another column in the dataset as Stock levels. Stock levels refer to the number of products a store or business has in its inventory. Now let’s have a look at the stock levels of each SKU:

stock_chart = px.line(data, x='SKU',  <p>
                      y='Stock levels',  <p>
                      title='Stock Levels by SKU') <p>
stock_chart.show() <p>
stock_chart = px.line(data, x='SKU',  <p>
                      y='Stock levels',  <p>
                      title='Stock Levels by SKU') <p> 
stock_chart.show() <p>

# Supply Chain Analysis: Stock Levels by SKU
Now let’s have a look at the order quantity of each SKU:

order_quantity_chart = px.bar(data, x='SKU',  <p>
                              y='Order quantities',  <p>
                              title='Order Quantity by SKU') <p>
order_quantity_chart.show() <p>
order_quantity_chart = px.bar(data, x='SKU',  <p>
                              y='Order quantities',  <p>
                              title='Order Quantity by SKU') <p>
order_quantity_chart.show() <p>

# Cost Analysis
Now let’s analyze the shipping cost of Carriers:

shipping_cost_chart = px.bar(data, x='Shipping carriers',  <p>
                             y='Shipping costs',  <p>
                             title='Shipping Costs by Carrier') <p>
shipping_cost_chart.show() <p>

shipping_cost_chart = px.bar(data, x='Shipping carriers',  <p>
                             y='Shipping costs',  <p>
                             title='Shipping Costs by Carrier') <p>
shipping_cost_chart.show() <p>

In one of the above visualizations, we discovered that Carrier B helps the company in more revenue. It is also the most costly Carrier among the three. Now let’s have a look at the cost distribution by transportation mode:

transportation_chart = px.pie(data,  <p>
                              values='Costs',  <p>
                              names='Transportation modes',  <p>
                              title='Cost Distribution by Transportation Mode', <p>
                              hole=0.5, <p>
                              color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel) <p>
transportation_chart.show() <p>

transportation_chart = px.pie(data,  <p>
                              values='Costs',  <p>
                              names='Transportation modes',  <p>
                              title='Cost Distribution by Transportation Mode', <p>
                              hole=0.5, <p>
                              color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel) <p>
transportation_chart.show() <p>

So the company spends more on Road and Rail modes of transportation for the transportation of Goods.

# Analyzing Defect Rate
The defect rate in the supply chain refers to the percentage of products that have something wrong or are found broken after shipping. Let’s have a look at the average defect rate of all product types:

defect_rates_by_product = data.groupby('Product type')['Defect rates'].mean().reset_index() <p>
 
fig = px.bar(defect_rates_by_product, x='Product type', y='Defect rates', <p>
             title='Average Defect Rates by Product Type') <p>
fig.show() <p>


defect_rates_by_product = data.groupby('Product type')['Defect rates'].mean().reset_index() <p>
fig = px.bar(defect_rates_by_product, x='Product type', y='Defect rates', <p> 
             title='Average Defect Rates by Product Type') <p>
fig.show() <p>

*So the defect rate of haircare products is higher. Now let’s have a look at the defect rates by mode of transportation:*

pivot_table = pd.pivot_table(data, values='Defect rates',  <p>
                             index=['Transportation modes'],  <p>
                             aggfunc='mean') <p>
transportation_chart = px.pie(values=pivot_table["Defect rates"],  <p>
                              names=pivot_table.index,  <p>
                              title='Defect Rates by Transportation Mode', <p>
                              hole=0.5, <p>
                              color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel) <p>
transportation_chart.show() <p>

pivot_table = pd.pivot_table(data, values='Defect rates', <p>
                             index=['Transportation modes'],  <p>
                             aggfunc='mean')<p>
transportation_chart = px.pie(values=pivot_table["Defect rates"],  <p>
                              names=pivot_table.index,  <p>
                              title='Defect Rates by Transportation Mode', <p>
                              hole=0.5, <p>
                              color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel) <p>
transportation_chart.show() <p>

*Road transportation results in a higher defect rate, and Air transportation has the lowest defect rate.*
